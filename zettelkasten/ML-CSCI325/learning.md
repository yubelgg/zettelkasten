# Types of learning

### Learning with different output space

There are different types of learning options:

- different output space $\gamma$
  - binary classification {-1, +1}
  - [[multiclass-classification|multiclass classification]]
  - regression
  - structured learning
- different data labels ${\gamma}_n$
- different input space $X$

### Learning with different **data labels**

- supervised
  - ${X}_n$ corresponds with ${\gamma}_n$
- unsupervised (clustering)
  - does not correspond with ${\gamma}_n$
- semi-supervised
- reinforcement learning

### Learning with different input space $X$

- [[concrete-features|concrete features]]
- [[raw-features|raw features]]
- abstract features
