# Multiclass Classification

Multiclass classification is the problem of classifying instances into one of more than two classes.

Input space $\mathcal{X}$ = Image features
Output space $\gamma$ = {cat, dog, bird, ...}

Other example:

- written digits: {0, 1, 2, ..., 9}
- pictures: {apple, orange, strawberry}

Especially used for **recognition**.
