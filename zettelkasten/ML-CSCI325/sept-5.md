# Linear Algebra

dot product tells us about how similar the vectors are
we normalize unit vector to give us direction
projection is how much p is projected onto q, perpendicular

Projections p onto q derection
cos0||p|| = p(q/||q||)

how much p is projected to q:
p\*q/||q|| <- scalar
q/||q|| <- unit vector
u = (pq/||q||)(q/||q||)
