# Linear Regression

linear regression: minimize prediction errors/finding the relationship
linear classifiers: maximize the separation between classes

## main idea

1. use least squares to fit a line to the data
2. calculate $R^2$
3. calculate a $p$-value for $R^2$

we draw a line through the chart
measure the distance of each data, square them, then sum them
**residual** is the distance from a line to a data point
rotate line then repeat
