# Datagram Networks

Networks that employ packet switching are called Datagram Networks. They receive this name because, in this context, we usually refer to packets as datagrams.

Each switch has a forwarding table that indicates the neighboring switch to which it should forward a datagram addressed to a given destination. 

We can conclude that datagram networks use packet switching and can forward packets with the same source and destination along different paths.
