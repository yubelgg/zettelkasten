# Introduction into ai

### What is AI?

Its the science of making agents such as machines and software that:

- thinks like people
- think rationally
  - achieving pre-defined goals to the best of its ability
  - being rational to maximized our expected utility (goals)
- act like people
- think like people

### What about the brain?

Brains are good at making rational decision but are not perfect

- AI may be better at brains for some tasks
- **AI aren't on the same scale as a human brain**
  - ~100 T brain synapses vs ~ 1.8 T weights in GPT-4 (higher is better)

### History Of AI

- 1940 - 1950: Early days; brain inspired computation

  - 1943: McCulloch & Pitts: Boolean circuit model

- 1950 - 1960:

- 1970 - 1990: Knowledge based approaches

  - 1969 - 1979: early dev of knowledge based systems
  - 1980 - 1988: backpropagation, feasible to train multi-layer neural networks

- 1990 - 2010:

  - resurgence of probability
  - agent and learning systems (AI spring)

- 2010 - 2017: Big data, GPUs, Deep Learning

  - 2011: Apple releases Siri
  - 2012: AlexNet winds ImageNet competition
  - 2015: DeepMind achieves "human level" skills at Atari games
  - 2016: Goodle translate switches to neural networks

- 2017 - present:

  - 2017: Google invents transformer architecture
  - 2021: Modern text to image generation
  - 2022: OpenAI realses ChatGPT
  - 2023: Lots of chatbots (Bard, LLaMA, Copilot)
