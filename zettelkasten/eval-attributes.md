# Evaluating Attributes

Attribute Grammars are a formal way to define the semantics of programming languages
by associating attributes with the grammar rules of the language. They extend
context-free grammars by adding attributes to the grammar's symbols and rules,
enabling a systematic way to describe how information flows through the language's
syntax and how certain semantic properties can be computed.
